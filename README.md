## Project Synopsis
This Capstone Project focuses on data analysis (Data Preparation, Understanding & Feature Engineering) and data visualization, aiming to provide recommendations and insights to optimize popularity and total revenue for Airbnb hosts in Bangkok. Analysis tools include Python (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib) for data processing and Tableau for creating interactive dashboards.

## Background
With Bangkok being a popular tourist destination, Airbnb hosts face increasing competition. This project examines key factors influencing Airbnb listing success, such as price, location, and listing attributes, to provide actionable insights for optimizing listings.

## Project Goals
1. Identify factors contributing to variations in Airbnb listing prices.
2. Determine which attributes affect listing popularity and revenue.
3. Explore spatial patterns in Airbnb listings across Bangkok neighborhoods.
